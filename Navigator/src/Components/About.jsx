      <h3 style={{ color: "teal" }}>
        Electronics is a scientific and engineering discipline that studies and applies the principles of
        physics to design, create, and operatedevices that manipulate electrons and other electrically charged particles.Electronics is the study of electricity (the flow of electrons)
        and how to use that to build things like computers. It uses circuits that are made with parts called components and connecting wires to do useful things.Electronics is the study
